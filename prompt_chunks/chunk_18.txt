Let me address both of your questions:

Regarding VisionSimulator duplication
You're right to question the potential duplication. Let's check the relationship between these files:


Opened client/src/components/baby-vision/VisionSimulator.tsx

Opened client/src/lib/image-utils.ts
You're absolutely right to point out this duplication. We have:

client/src/components/baby-vision/VisionSimulator.tsx - Contains a class with a static simulateBabyVision method
client/src/lib/image-utils.ts - Imports and re-exports the proper implementation from babyVisionSimulator.ts
client/src/lib/baby-vision/babyVisionSimulator.ts - The actual implementation with simulateInfantVision
This is indeed a duplication that should be resolved. We should remove the implementation in VisionSimulator.tsx and use the proper imported version from image-utils.ts instead.

Regarding the storage, auth, and method duplications
You've correctly identified several significant issues:

Storage Interface Duplications:

We have two IStorage interfaces in different locations
The comprehensive one is in server/storage/interfaces/IStorage.ts
A smaller one is in server/storage.ts
Storage Implementation Duplications:

MemStorage implementations in both locations
PgStorage implementation in server/storage.ts
Auth-Related Duplications:

Utilities in server/auth.ts
Routes in server/routes/auth.ts (which is expected, but might have duplicate logic)
Method Inconsistencies:

Inconsistent naming (getBabiesByParent vs getBabiesByParentId)
Different signatures for similar functions
Import Inconsistencies:

Different import paths for the same modules
I recommend we address these issues in the following order:

First, consolidate the storage interfaces into a single comprehensive interface
Standardize the method names across all implementations
Consolidate the storage implementations (MemStorage and DatabaseStorage)
Fix the import paths throughout the codebase
Check for and eliminate any auth-related duplications
Let's start by examining the two storage interfaces to see how to best consolidate them:


Opened server/storage.ts

Opened server/storage.ts
Let's continue reviewing:


Opened server/storage.ts

Opened server/storage.ts
Now that I've reviewed both storage interfaces, I recommend the following approach to consolidate them:

We should keep the more comprehensive interface from server/storage/interfaces/IStorage.ts as our base.
We should add methods that are only in server/storage.ts (like getDatabaseStats) to this comprehensive interface.
We need to standardize method names (e.g., getBabyById vs getBaby).
We need to consolidate both implementations (MemStorage and DatabaseStorage) to match the unified interface.
Let's now check how routes are using these storage interfaces:


Opened server/routes/baby.ts
Now let's check how database.ts is using storage:


Searched for "Find all files that import or use database storage or MemStorage"

Opened server/db.ts
Based on my comprehensive review, here's what we should do to address your concerns:

1. Storage Interface and Implementation Duplications
The codebase is in a transition state with two parallel implementations:

Old Approach (server/storage.ts):

Contains a simpler IStorage interface
Has both MemStorage and PgStorage implementations
Supports fewer entity types (Users, Babies, GrowthMeasurements, Events)
New Modular Approach (server/storage/):

Has a comprehensive IStorage interface
Uses composition for MemStorage implementation with specialized classes
Supports many entity types (over a dozen)
As per the refactoring plan, is about 70% complete
2. Recommended Solution for Storage
