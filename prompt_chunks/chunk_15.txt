/server/routes.ts - Contains all the route implementations in a single file
/server/routes/*.ts files (user.ts, growth.ts, event.ts, system.ts, etc.) - Duplicated modular implementations
This setup is confusing and will cause issues. We need to:

Keep only one approach (either the modular files or the single file, but not both)
Update server/index.ts to use the chosen approach
Since we're aiming for a more modular architecture, let's modify server/index.ts to use the routes directly from routes.ts instead of routes/index.ts, and then focus on properly moving all routes to the modular files later if needed.


Edited server/index.ts
Now let's start the server with our updated code:


Restarted Baby App Dev
Let's summarize the current situation and our next steps:

We had originally created modular route files (user.ts, system.ts, growth.ts, event.ts, etc.) in the server/routes/ directory.
However, the server/routes.ts file still exists and contains all the route definitions.
We've updated server/index.ts to use the routes from server/routes.ts directly instead of trying to use the modular structure.
Going forward, we have two options:

Keep using server/routes.ts as the single source of truth for routes

Pros: Simpler, already working
Cons: Less modular, harder to maintain as the app grows
Move completely to the modular structure in server/routes/

Pros: More maintainable, better separation of concerns
Cons: Requires more work to ensure consistency
What would you like me to do? Would you prefer to:

Clean up by removing the modular route files since we're now using the consolidated routes.ts file
Go all-in on the modular structure by properly implementing it and removing routes.ts
Something else?

I'll move completely to the modular structure in server/routes/ directory. This will make the codebase more maintainable and follow better separation of concerns.

First, let's check our server/routes/index.ts to make sure it can serve as the main routing hub:


Opened server/routes/index.ts
Now let's check if we have a baby.ts route file:


Opened server/routes/baby.ts
Great! Now let's update the baby.ts file to follow the same pattern we used for the other route files and fix the missing methods:


Edited server/routes/baby.ts
Now let's modify the baby.ts file to follow the Router pattern:


Edited server/routes/baby.ts
Now we need to update the server/index.ts file to use all our modular routes:


Edited server/index.ts
Now let's delete the routes.ts file since we've moved everything to the modular structure:


Executed mv server/routes.ts server/routes.ts.bak
Let's restart the server to test our changes:


Restarted Baby App Dev
Let's summarize what we've accomplished:

Want users to get these changes? Redeploy this App.
We've updated deployment pricing—see what's new.
The agent has reported new progress:
✓ Moved completely to a modular server/routes structure
✓ Converted each route file to use Router pattern
✓ Fixed storage imports to use default export
✓ Added missing storage methods for proper functionality
✓ Updated server/index.ts to use the modular routes
✓ Removed routes.ts and kept only modular structure
✓ Ensured proper dependency injection in registerRoutes

What would you like me to work on next?

do we have more duplications on the project?

Let me look for more duplications in the project. I'll check the codebase to identify any other instances of duplicated code or functionality.


Executed find server -type f -name "*.ts" | sort
I see there are potentially duplicated storage implementations. Let's examine the main storage files and the storage directory to understand if there are duplications there:
