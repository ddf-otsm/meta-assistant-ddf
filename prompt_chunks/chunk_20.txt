We replaced the duplicate implementation with a wrapper that calls the proper implementation from image-utils.ts
We added the missing methods: getStageByAge and toDataURL
The component files BabyVision.tsx don't actually import VisionSimulator.tsx at all, but directly use the functions from babyVisionSimulator.ts
Let's make sure we didn't miss any VisionSimulator.tsx references (the way you would use a React component vs a class):


Executed find client/src -type f -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.ts" | xargs grep -l "VisionSimulator"
Let's check if BabyVision.tsx actually uses VisionSimulator:


Executed grep -A 10 "VisionSimulator" client/src/pages/BabyVision.tsx
Let's check how image-utils.ts is using VisionSimulator:


Executed grep -A 10 "VisionSimulator" client/src/lib/image-utils.ts
Great! It looks like we fixed the duplication issue in VisionSimulator.tsx successfully. The file is now a thin wrapper around the proper implementation, and no other files are directly importing VisionSimulator as a component.

Now let's move to the storage refactoring task. First, let's examine the structure of the modular approach:


Executed find server/storage -type f -name "*.ts"
Now let's check the comprehensive IStorage interface:


Opened server/storage/interfaces/IStorage.ts
Let's continue reviewing the interface:


Opened server/storage/interfaces/IStorage.ts
Let's continue reviewing the interface:


Opened server/storage/interfaces/IStorage.ts
Let's finish reviewing the comprehensive interface:


Opened server/storage/interfaces/IStorage.ts
Now let's look at the main implementation for the newer approach:


Opened server/storage/implementations/MemStorage.ts
Let's continue:


Opened server/storage/implementations/MemStorage.ts
Let's continue:


Opened server/storage/implementations/MemStorage.ts
Let's check the implementation of a specific method:


Opened server/storage/implementations/MemStorage.ts
Let's continue:


Opened server/storage/implementations/MemStorage.ts
Let's check the implementation of the UserStorage class:


Opened server/storage/implementations/memory/UserStorage.ts
Now, let's look at the BabyStorage implementation:


Opened server/storage/implementations/memory/BabyStorage.ts
Let's check an entry from server/storage/implementations/MemStorage.ts for the delegation pattern:


Opened server/storage/implementations/MemStorage.ts
Let's look at this module implementation approach more closely:


Opened server/storage/implementations/DatabaseStorage.ts
Based on my extensive analysis, here are my conclusions about the storage duplication issue:

Current State
Original Storage Implementation (server/storage.ts):

Simple interface with basic operations
Focused on users, babies, growth measurements, and events
Uses a monolithic approach (all code in a single file)
Method names are inconsistent with the new approach (getBabyById vs getBaby)
Used by original routes
New Modular Storage Implementation (server/storage/):

Comprehensive interface with many more operations
Uses composition with specialized storage classes
Well-organized directory structure and better code organization
Method names follow consistent patterns (getBaby, getBabiesByParent)
About 70% complete according to refactoring plan
Plan to Update the Storage Implementation
First Step: Standardize Method Names

Update the methods in the IStorage interface (server/storage/interfaces/IStorage.ts) to include methods from server/storage.ts that aren't already there
Add methods like getDatabaseStats, getUsers, getUsersByRole, etc.
Standardize naming conventions (e.g., getBaby vs getBabyById)
Second Step: Update Storage Implementations

Implement the added methods in MemStorage (server/storage/implementations/MemStorage.ts)
Implement the added methods in DatabaseStorage (server/storage/implementations/DatabaseStorage.ts)
Third Step: Create a Compatibility Layer
