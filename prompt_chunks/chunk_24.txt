User operations (getUsers, getUserById, getUserByEmail, getUsersByRole)
Event operations (getEvents, getEvent...)
Growth Measurement operations
Let's check if we've missed any other essential methods from IStorage:


Opened server/storage/interfaces/IStorage.ts
Based on our review of IStorage methods and our MemStorage implementation, we need to add the following missing methods to MemStorage:

updateUser, deleteUser
getBabies, getBabiesByParentId, getBabyById, updateBaby, deleteBaby
getEvents (which we just added)
resetDatabase, getDatabaseStats
Let's implement these:


Edited server/storage/implementations/MemStorage.ts
Now, let's add the baby methods:


Edited server/storage/implementations/MemStorage.ts
Finally, let's add the system methods (resetDatabase, getDatabaseStats) to MemStorage:


Executed grep -n "resetDatabase\|getDatabaseStats" server/storage/implementations/MemStorage.ts
Let's add the system methods at the end of the MemStorage class:


Edited server/storage/implementations/MemStorage.ts
