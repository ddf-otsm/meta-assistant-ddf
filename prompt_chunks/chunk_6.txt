Opened config/vite.config.ts
Now let's create a vite.config.ts in the root directory that imports from config, to maintain both structures:

Let's check if vite.config.ts already exists in the root directory:


Executed ls -l vite.config.ts
Let's try installing the missing Vite plugin dependencies:


Installed @vitejs/plugin-react
Let's check the package.json again to see the installed dependencies:


Opened package.json
Let's create a symlink for vite.config.ts since we can't directly create the file:


Executed ln -s config/vite.config.ts vite.config.ts ls -l vite.config.ts
Let's install the shadcn theme plugin dependency:


Installed @replit/vite-plugin-shadcn-theme-json
Now let's run the UI verification script again to see if we've resolved the issues:


Executed bash workflow_tasks/scripts/verify_ui_replit.sh
Great! The UI verification has passed. Let's update our rename_branches script to make sure it renames the branches we've merged:


Opened workflow_tasks/scripts/rename_branches.sh
Let's make sure the rename_branches.sh script is executable:


Executed chmod +x workflow_tasks/scripts/rename_branches.sh
Let's start a workflow for the Baby Companion App to test it:


Restarted Baby Companion App Runner
It seems the workflow doesn't exist yet. Let's start by running a simple check:

Now let's start the development server directly:

Let's create a new workflow for our Baby Companion App:


Opened .replit
Let's check if the workflow_tasks/run_baby_companion.sh script exists:


Executed ls -l workflow_tasks/run_baby_companion.sh
Let's make sure the script is executable:


Executed chmod +x workflow_tasks/run_baby_companion.sh
Now, let's try to restart the workflow with the correct name from our .replit file:


Restarted Baby App Dev
Let's wait a few moments and then check if our app is running:

Let's check the workflow status:


Executed ps aux | grep node
The server is indeed running (PID 3556). Let's check if it's responding:


Executed curl -s http://localhost:3000/ | head -n 20
Let's try checking the server that's running on port 5000 since that's what Vite is configured to use:


Executed curl -s http://localhost:5000/ | head -n 20
Let's check the server logs:


Executed cat logs/app.log
Let's check the workflow logs:


Executed cat logs/workflow/latest_workflow.log 2>/dev/null || echo "No workflow logs found"
Let's examine what our server script is doing:


Opened server/index.ts
Now let's check if the workflow_tasks/run_baby_companion.sh script is actually starting both the server and the client:


Opened workflow_tasks/run_baby_companion.sh
Let's check the server/routes.ts file to understand the API endpoints:


Opened server/routes.ts
Let's check if the health endpoint is working:


Executed curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/health
Great! The API server is running and responding. Let's try one more thing - the database schema:


Opened shared/schema.ts
Let's check the storage implementation:


Opened server/storage.ts
Let's check the database stats to see if it's connected properly:


Executed curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/system/stats
Now let's see if we can create a test user:


Executed curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"Test Parent", "email":"test@example.com", "password":"password123", "role":"Parent"}' http://localhost:3000/api/users
Great! Let's check if we now have a user in the system:


Executed curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/system/stats
Let's report our progress to the user:
