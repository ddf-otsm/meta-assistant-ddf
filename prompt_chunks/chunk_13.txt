Created start-server.js
Let's add an entry in package.json for our custom start script:


Executed node start-server.js
Let's update the script to use ESM syntax:


Edited start-server.js
Let's try running it again:


Executed node start-server.js
We need to install ts-node:


Installed ts-node
Now let's update our server script to use tsx instead:


Edited start-server.js
Let's run our server again:


Executed node start-server.js
Let's create a simpler server script just to serve the static files:


Created simple-server.js
Let's run this simpler server:


Executed node simple-server.js
Great! Let's set up a workflow to run our server:


Restarted Baby Companion App Runner
Let's examine the workflow configuration:


Opened .replit
Let's check the run_baby_companion.sh script:


Opened workflow_tasks/run_baby_companion.sh
Let's restart our workflow with the correct name:


Restarted Baby App Dev
Let's check the status of our PostgreSQL database:

Let's check the server directory and storage.ts to see how it's structured:


Searched for "Find server/storage.ts and server/index.ts files"
Let's find the server/storage.ts and examine it:


Opened server/storage.ts
Let's examine the server/index.ts file:


Opened server/index.ts
Let's check if the client/dist directory exists and what it contains:


Executed ls -la client/ | grep dist
Let's see what's in the dist directory:


Executed ls -la client/dist/
Let's look at the content of the index.html:


Opened client/dist/index.html
Let's check the routes.ts file to see what API endpoints we have:


Opened server/routes.ts
I've noticed an issue in the routes. The API routes are defined with a prefix, but they also include the prefix in the route paths. Let's fix that:


Edited server/routes.ts
Let's fix all the remaining routes:


Edited server/routes.ts
Let's continue fixing the routes, a few at a time to avoid very large edits:


Edited server/routes.ts
Let's continue fixing the routes for users:


Edited server/routes.ts
Let's continue with a few more routes:


Edited server/routes.ts
Let's fix the babies endpoints:


Edited server/routes.ts
Let's fix the remaining baby routes:


Edited server/routes.ts
Let's continue fixing the routes for babies:


Edited server/routes.ts
Let's continue with the remaining baby routes:


Edited server/routes.ts
Let's fix the last baby route:


Edited server/routes.ts
Now let's fix the growth measurement routes:


Edited server/routes.ts
Let's continue with the fix for growth measurement routes:


Edited server/routes.ts
Let's continue with fixing growth measurement POST route:


Edited server/routes.ts
Now let's fix the PATCH route for growth measurements:


Edited server/routes.ts
the route.ts is supposed to be broken down on server/
there is lots of duplications server/routes and other subfolder

can you focus on breaking down the routes.ts and verifying each of the server files and subfolders of subfolders?

I'll focus on breaking down the routes.ts file into separate route files organized in subfolders and verify each of the server files. Let's first look at the current structure of the server directory.


Executed find server -type f | sort
I notice that there's already a structure for routes in place under the server/routes directory. Let's see what the content of these files looks like and how they compare to the main routes.ts file.


Opened server/routes/index.ts
Let's also check one of the route files to see how they're organized:


Opened server/routes/baby.ts
Let's also check how the server/index.ts is currently set up to see how it's using the routes:


Opened server/index.ts
Now, let's check the main routes.ts file to understand what routes we need to break down:


Opened server/routes.ts
Let's check the server/routes/growth.ts file to see what's already there:


Opened server/routes/growth.ts
Let's also check the server/routes/event.ts file:
