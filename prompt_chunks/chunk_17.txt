Restarted Baby Companion App Runner
Let's check for a workflow file:


Executed find . -type f -name "*.sh" | grep -E "run|start|dev"
Let's create a workflow for our app:


Opened .replit
Let's examine and fix the main run script:


Opened workflow_tasks/run_baby_companion.sh
Let's check if we have the required scripts for the workflow:


Opened package.json
Let's modify the .replit file to create a proper workflow:

We can't directly edit the .replit file. Let's create a new script to launch the server:


Created run-app.js
Let's try installing missing dependencies on the server side:


Installed express-session, memorystore, passport, passport-local
Let's now fix the import errors in server/routes/index.ts:


Opened server/routes/index.ts
Now let's fix the Express import issues in other route files:


Opened server/routes/baby.ts
Let's check server/index.ts to see if the Express imports need to be fixed:


Opened server/index.ts
Let's check the full server/index.ts file to fix the issues with Express typings:


Opened server/index.ts
Let's fix the server/index.ts file to fix the TypeScript errors:


Edited server/index.ts
Let's fix the app variable type in server/index.ts:


Edited server/index.ts
Let's try a different approach to fix the Express types. Let's check the @types/express:


Installed @types/express, @types/express-session, @types/passport, @types/passport-local
Let's fix the server/index.ts file with the correct import now:

Let's fix the httpServer.listen issue in server/index.ts:


Edited server/index.ts
Let's try to start the server to see what other issues we might encounter:


Executed node run-app.js
We need to install the ws package:


Installed ws
Let's create a workflow for running the app:

Let's use the native Replit workflow functionality:


Restarted Baby App Dev
Let's summarize the changes we've made:

The agent has reported new progress:
✓ Fixed Badge component in UI to support children prop
✓ Updated VisionSimulator to use correct vision stage properties
✓ Installed missing dependencies for server (express-session, memorystore, passport, passport-local, ws)
✓ Installed typescript type definitions (@types/express, @types/express-session, @types/passport, @types/passport-local)
✓ Fixed type issues in server/index.ts and other files
→ Need to continue with other type and implementation fixes
What would you like to focus on next?

#1
Did you check if these are not duplications?
Opened client/src/components/baby-vision/VisionSimulator.tsx
Opened client/src/lib/baby-vision/babyVisionSimulator.ts

#2
After examining the codebase, I've identified several duplications and inconsistencies that need to be addressed:

Storage Interface Duplications: There are two different storage interfaces:

server/storage/interfaces/IStorage.ts (comprehensive interface with many methods)
server/storage.ts (has its own IStorage interface with fewer methods)
Storage Implementation Duplications:

server/storage/implementations/MemStorage.ts (comprehensive implementation)
server/storage.ts (has its own MemStorage and PgStorage implementations)
Auth-Related Duplications:

server/auth.ts (authentication utilities)
server/routes/auth.ts (authentication routes)
Method Inconsistencies:

Methods in baby.ts route file reference methods like getBabiesByParent but storage.ts uses getBabiesByParentId
Different method signatures and naming conventions between different storage implementations
Import Inconsistencies:

Some files import storage from "../storage"
Others use import storage from "../storage"
These duplications could lead to bugs and maintenance difficulties. We should consolidate the storage implementations and ensure consistent naming across the codebase.

Would you like me to address these duplications by:

Consolidating the storage interfaces and implementations
Standardizing the method names across the codebase
Fixing the import inconsistencies
Or focusing on another area of duplication?
