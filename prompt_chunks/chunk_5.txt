Executed mkdir -p logs bash workflow_tasks/scripts/custom_branch_merge.sh --dry-run
Great news! The dry run shows no potential merge conflicts with any of the branches. Let's proceed with the actual merge:


Executed bash workflow_tasks/scripts/custom_branch_merge.sh
We have some merge conflicts when trying to merge the origin/agent-minion-replit-1-deploy-unknown branch. Since the dry run didn't show any conflicts, it might be because the merge algorithms in the dry run and actual merge operate differently.

Let's try resolving these conflicts using the 'ours' strategy since we want to prioritize our current branch's code:


Executed git merge --abort git merge -X ours origin/agent-minion-replit-1-deploy-unknown -m "Merge branch 'origin/agent-minion-replit-1-deploy-unknown' into agent-minion-replit-0-v1.1.0-merged-previous-versions-unknown (ours strategy)"
We need to set up Git user configuration first:


Executed git config --global user.email "agent@example.com" git config --global user.name "Agent Minion" git merge -X ours origin/agent-minion-replit-1-deploy-unknown -m "Merge branch 'origin/agent-minion-replit-1-deploy-unknown' into agent-minion-replit-0-v1.1.0-merged-previous-versions-unknown (ours strategy)"
We still have a conflict with the directory rename. Let's try to resolve this by keeping our directory structure:


Executed git merge --abort git add . git status
Let's try to commit our changes first and then attempt a different merge strategy:


Executed git commit -m "Add merge scripts and update plan" git merge origin/agent-minion-replit-1-deploy-unknown -s recursive -X theirs -m "Merge branch 'origin/agent-minion-replit-1-deploy-unknown' using theirs strategy"
We're still having issues with the directory renames. Let's try a different approach by selectively copying key files from the agent-minion-replit-1-deploy-unknown branch instead of doing a full merge:


Executed git merge --abort # Let's try an alternative approach by checking out key files from the branch mkdir -p tmp_merge_files git show origin/agent-minion-replit-1-deploy-unknown:package.json > tmp_merge_files/package.json git show origin/agent-minion-replit-1-deploy-unknown:config/drizzle.config.ts > tmp_merge_files/drizzle.config.ts git show origin/agent-minion-replit-1-deploy-unknown:README.md > tmp_merge_files/README.md # Let's see what files we got ls -la tmp_merge_files/
Now let's examine our current package.json to see what changes we might need to merge:


Opened package.json
Now let's check the package.json from the branch we're trying to merge:


Opened tmp_merge_files/package.json
Now let's check the drizzle.config.ts from the branch we're trying to merge:


Opened tmp_merge_files/drizzle.config.ts
Let's also check our current drizzle.config.ts:


Opened config/drizzle.config.ts
Now let's look at the README from both branches:


Opened README.md

Opened tmp_merge_files/README.md
Based on the files from both branches, I recommend we continue with our current approach but incorporate valuable parts from the other branch. Let's start by updating our package.json to include the missing dependencies and scripts:

I see we can't edit package.json directly. Let's update our drizzle config file based on the changes needed:


Edited config/drizzle.config.ts
Let's update the README.md with some additional information from the other branch:

Let's try updating the README using bash:

Let's try with the str_replace_editor one more time but with a shorter update:


Executed cp README.md README.md.bak
Let's continue with our verification process by using our script to check the UI after our updates to drizzle.config.ts:


Executed bash workflow_tasks/scripts/verify_ui_replit.sh
We need to address a few issues with missing files and dependencies:

First, let's install the missing dependencies:

Installed react
Now let's create the vite.config.ts file in the correct location:
