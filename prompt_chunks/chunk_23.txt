It properly delegates calls to the core implementation
It provides a simplified interface for components that need this functionality
It avoids duplicating complex logic
Implementation Status and Next Steps
Storage Module Migration
 Step 1: Created standardized interface
 Step 2: Created storage wrapper
 Step 3: Added storage factory
 Step 4: Update MemStorage and DatabaseStorage implementations to implement all interface methods
 Step 5: Update routes to use the wrapper
 Step 6: Delete the old storage.ts file
Baby Vision Architecture
 Confirmed VisionSimulator is correctly implemented as a thin wrapper
 Verified no code duplication in core logic
 Ensured proper delegation pattern is being used
Additional Suggestions
Move all remaining image utilities from image-utils.ts to the baby-vision directory
Update imports in components to use the VisionSimulator wrapper consistently
Document the architecture more clearly to prevent future duplications
Add unit tests to ensure behavior stays consistent during migration
Is there a particular part of this implementation you'd like me to focus on next?

#1 Double check?

Next Steps
To complete the storage migration, I recommend the following additional steps:

Update the MemStorage and DatabaseStorage Implementations

Implement all the methods defined in the IStorage interface
Fix the type errors in the current implementations
Update Routes to Use the Wrapper

Modify all routes to import storage from server/storage.wrapper.ts
Test each route after updating
Gradually Update Routes to Use New Method Names

Update routes to use the standardized method names
Test each route after updating
Delete server/storage.ts

Once all routes are using the wrapper, remove the original storage file

#2 continue

Step 4: Update MemStorage and DatabaseStorage implementations to implement all interface methods
Step 5: Update routes to use the wrapper
Step 6: Delete the old storage.ts file

You're right, I should double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything important, then continue with implementing the next steps.

Double-Checking Storage Implementation

Opened server/storage/implementations/MemStorage.ts
Let's check what methods are missing from this implementation compared to our IStorage interface:


Opened server/storage/implementations/MemStorage.ts
Now I'll check if I can find event-related methods to see what might be missing:


Opened server/storage/implementations/MemStorage.ts
Let's find the event-related methods:


Searched for "find event methods in MemStorage implementations"
Let's check the EventStorage implementation:


Opened server/storage/implementations/memory/EventStorage.ts
Now I'll check how the events are handled in the MemStorage main class:


Searched for ""
Now I'll update the MemStorage implementation to include the missing methods from our IStorage interface:


Edited server/storage/implementations/MemStorage.ts
Now I'll check the MemStorage implementation for growth measurement methods:


Executed grep -n "growth" server/storage/implementations/MemStorage.ts
Let's find growth measurement methods in the original storage.ts file:


Executed grep -n "Growth" server/storage.ts | head -20
Let's implement these methods in MemStorage:


Edited server/storage/implementations/MemStorage.ts
Now, let's add missing getUsers methods to the MemStorage class:


Edited server/storage/implementations/MemStorage.ts
Let's check if the basic methods for events are implemented in MemStorage:


Executed grep -n "getEvent" server/storage/implementations/MemStorage.ts
Now let's check for missing method getEvents:


Executed grep -n "createEvent\|updateEvent\|deleteEvent\|getEvents(" server/storage/implementations/MemStorage.ts
Let's add the missing getEvents method:


Edited server/storage/implementations/MemStorage.ts
Let's check the status of our implementation of the storage interface in MemStorage. We've already added methods for:
