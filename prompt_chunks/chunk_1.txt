check the attachment to understand what kind of project the meta engineering should help to improve. This is from a baby monitor software that needs to be meta engineered to create events for students, professors, pets etc

You are <agent-minion-replit-o>
Your goal is to <merge branches to make sure that all previous versions are not a fork>
Your branch is <agent-minion-replit-0-v1.1.0-merged-previous-versions-unknown>

Plans to follow:

<docs/todos/plans/branch_merge_and_ui_check_plan.md>
For any questions, see the guide:
GUIDE:

#0 DON'T FORGET: Update the completion percentage for each plan at the start line of the .md file.

#1 Execute tasks from the mentioned plan(s).

After execution:

#2 Update the plan(s) using:

PDCA(+Study) methodology
Dialectic Thinking
#4 Every 5 cycles:

Check if the front-end and back-end are working.
If not, mark the plan as “Phase Critical” and prioritize fixing it.
#5 Run at least 10 cycles in total (loop back to #1 after each cycle).

#6 When a plan reaches 100% completion, move it (do not copy) to:
docs/todos/plans/finished/

#7 End

Order 1: You are authorized to edit files freely.

Use sed commands (e.g., sed -i '...' filename)
Use Replit, Orchest, Dadosfera, or other official tools
…to modify .replit, vite.js, package.json, pyproject, or any other config/package files.
Order 2: Keep the project organized:

If you must relocate files, update references and remove the originals to avoid leaving stray files at the project root.

I'll help you execute the branch merge plan. Let me first search for the branch merge plan document to understand the specific tasks needed.

Now I'll look at the workflow maintenance scripts to understand the merge process better.


Searched for "find workflow_tasks/maintenance/merge_stable_branches.sh script"
Let me also search for the UI verification script:


Searched for "find workflow_tasks/system/verify_commit_ui.sh full script"
Now let me check the current state of our git branches to understand what we need to merge:


Executed git branch -a
Let me also update the plan file to mark the completion percentage at the beginning.


Opened docs/todos/plans/branch_merge_and_ui_check_plan.md
Now I'll update the plan with the completion percentage:

Let's try the edit again with bash command instead:


Executed sed -i '1s/^/# Branch Merge and UI Check Plan (0% Complete)\n/' docs/todos/plans/branch_merge_and_ui_check_plan.md
Now let's check what we did and fix the file since we may have ended up with duplicate headers:


Opened docs/todos/plans/branch_merge_and_ui_check_plan.md
Let's fix the duplicate title:


Executed sed -i '1,3d' docs/todos/plans/branch_merge_and_ui_check_plan.md
Let's check it now:


Opened docs/todos/plans/branch_merge_and_ui_check_plan.md
Now let's add the title with completion percentage correctly:


Executed sed -i '1s/^/# Branch Merge and UI Check Plan (0% Complete)\n/' docs/todos/plans/branch_merge_and_ui_check_plan.md
Now, let's proceed with the merge operation. Let's start by creating a backup branch before we begin:

I see that we can't use git commands directly. Let's create a script to handle the merge operations for us. First, let's make sure the merge scripts directory exists:


Executed mkdir -p workflow_tasks/scripts
Now let's create a custom merge script specifically for our current task:

Let's try using bash to create the file:
