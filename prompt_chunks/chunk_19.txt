Use the more comprehensive interface at server/storage/interfaces/IStorage.ts
Ensure all methods in the simpler interface are also in the comprehensive one
Standardize method naming (e.g., getBaby vs getBabyById)
Complete remaining MemStorage component implementations
Fix the modular PgStorage implementation
Update the main storage.ts file:

Make it import the modular implementations
Export a singleton instance based on environment
Ensure backwards compatibility with existing code
Update route implementations:

Gradually update route files to use the standardized method names
Fix any type issues with returns (undefined vs null)
3. VisionSimulator Duplication
There's a clear duplication problem:

client/components/baby-vision/VisionSimulator.tsx:
Contains a redundant implementation of simulateBabyVision
Uses string properties (blurRadius, brightness, contrast) not in the model
client/lib/baby-vision/babyVisionSimulator.ts:
Contains the correct implementation that uses InfantVisionStage properties
Already used by image-utils.ts
Solution: Replace the VisionSimulator implementation with just a thin wrapper around the functions from image-utils.ts, which already provide the correct functionality.

Action Plan
Since there are multiple overlapping issues, I recommend tackling them in this order:

Fix the VisionSimulator duplication first (smaller, more contained issue)
Update the storage.ts file to support both old and new interfaces during transition
Standardize method naming across storage implementations
Update routes to use the standardized method names
Would you like me to start with any of these specific tasks?

New Modular Approach (server/storage/):

Has a comprehensive IStorage interface
Uses composition for MemStorage implementation with specialized classes
Supports many entity types (over a dozen)
As per the refactoring plan, is about 70% complete

I'll fix the VisionSimulator duplication first and then start the storage refactoring work. Let's begin:

1. Fixing the VisionSimulator Duplication
First, let's replace the duplicate implementation in VisionSimulator.tsx with a proper wrapper for the functions from image-utils.ts:


Edited client/src/components/baby-vision/VisionSimulator.tsx
Now, let's verify the rest of the file:


Opened client/src/components/baby-vision/VisionSimulator.tsx
Great! Now let's check the source functions we're using from image-utils.ts:


Opened client/src/lib/image-utils.ts
Let's also check babyVisionSimulator.tsx file that we're using:

Let's check if it's a .ts file instead:


Opened client/src/lib/baby-vision/babyVisionSimulator.ts
Now, let's check the infantVisionStages.ts file:


Opened client/src/lib/baby-vision/infantVisionStages.ts
Great! Now we need to see if there are other files using the VisionSimulator component to ensure our changes don't break anything:


Searched for "Find files that import or use VisionSimulator"

Searched for "Find components that import VisionSimulator"

Opened client/src/pages/BabyVision.tsx
Perfect! Now I can complete the first task - fixing the VisionSimulator duplication.

Our fix in VisionSimulator.tsx should be working correctly:
