Let's check if there's any duplication between the auth.ts files:


Opened server/auth.ts

Opened server/routes/auth.ts
Let's look for any duplications in the server/storage.ts file:


Opened server/storage.ts
Let's check the server/storage/interfaces/IStorage.ts:


Opened server/storage/interfaces/IStorage.ts
After examining the codebase, I've identified several duplications and inconsistencies that need to be addressed:

Storage Interface Duplications: There are two different storage interfaces:

server/storage/interfaces/IStorage.ts (comprehensive interface with many methods)
server/storage.ts (has its own IStorage interface with fewer methods)
Storage Implementation Duplications:

server/storage/implementations/MemStorage.ts (comprehensive implementation)
server/storage.ts (has its own MemStorage and PgStorage implementations)
Auth-Related Duplications:

server/auth.ts (authentication utilities)
server/routes/auth.ts (authentication routes)
Method Inconsistencies:

Methods in baby.ts route file reference methods like getBabiesByParent but storage.ts uses getBabiesByParentId
Different method signatures and naming conventions between different storage implementations
Import Inconsistencies:

Some files import storage from "../storage"
Others use import storage from "../storage"
These duplications could lead to bugs and maintenance difficulties. We should consolidate the storage implementations and ensure consistent naming across the codebase.

Would you like me to address these duplications by:

Consolidating the storage interfaces and implementations
Standardizing the method names across the codebase
Fixing the import inconsistencies
Or focusing on another area of duplication?

I'll help fix these build errors. It looks like we're missing several dependencies and have some type issues. Let's address them step by step.

First, let's install the missing dependencies:


Installed lucide-react,, react-hook-form,, @hookform/resolvers,, date-fns,, recharts,, @radix-ui/react-accordion
Oops! Let me fix those package names (removing the commas):


Installed lucide-react, react-hook-form, @hookform/resolvers, date-fns, recharts, @radix-ui/react-accordion
Now let's fix the type issues in our code, starting with the App.tsx file:


Opened client/src/App.tsx
Let's fix the ReactNode type issue in App.tsx:


Edited client/src/App.tsx
Now let's fix the Badge component issue. First, let's look at the Badge component definition:


Opened client/src/components/ui/badge.tsx
Now let's fix the Badge component to support children prop:


Edited client/src/components/ui/badge.tsx
Now, let's fix the VisionSimulator issue. Let's check the InfantVisionStage interface:


Opened client/src/components/baby-vision/VisionSimulator.tsx
Let's look at the visionStages implementation:


Opened client/src/lib/image-utils.ts
Let's check the InfantVisionStage interface:


Opened client/src/lib/baby-vision/infantVisionStages.ts
Let's check how these stages are used in the vision simulator:


Opened client/src/lib/baby-vision/babyVisionSimulator.ts
Let's check the baby vision filters:


Opened client/src/lib/baby-vision/babyVisionFilters.ts
Now let's fix the VisionSimulator.tsx file to match the correct interface properties:

Let's see more of the VisionSimulator.tsx file:


Opened client/src/components/baby-vision/VisionSimulator.tsx
Now let's fix the VisionSimulator.tsx file:


Edited client/src/components/baby-vision/VisionSimulator.tsx
Let's fix the class-variance-authority dependency:


Installed class-variance-authority
Now let's fix the App.tsx issues. First, let's check the file:


Opened client/src/App.tsx
The App.tsx file looks correct and properly formatted. Let's set up a workflow to run the server:
