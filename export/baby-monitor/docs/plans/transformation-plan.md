# Baby Monitor Transformation Plan - 100% Complete

Use the baby monitor to create a plan

checkout this branch at ./submodules folder as a submodule git
https://github.com/ddf-otsm/baby-monitor/tree/v1.0.2-stable-front-back

The MetaEngineering Assistant needs to create a set of proposed files and documentations to help an agent or the user to understand and create generetors for this project as a E2E test.

The final goal is to be able to transform the baby monitor into a Kettle Monitor

Keep in mind that it needs to be compatible with the trasnformation into a Pet Monitor for a Tutor, Student Monitor for a School or Professor, and a Developer Monitor for a Project Management

## Current Status
- Created the submodules directory
- Cloned the baby-monitor repository as a git submodule
- Analyzed the project structure
- Created comprehensive transformation documentation:
  - Overall transformation plan
  - Generator system architecture
  - Generator implementation details
  - Kettle monitor implementation example
  - Pet monitor implementation example
  - Project README
- Created basic generator implementation:
  - Directory structure for generators
  - Core generator script (run_generator.js)
  - Template-based transformer utility
  - Domain-specific configuration for kettle monitor
  - Template files for entity model and UI components
- Implemented E2E testing for the generator
- Created directory for finished plans

## Completed
This plan has been completed. The transformation system allows converting the Baby Monitor into different domain-specific monitoring applications, with detailed documentation and implementation examples.

The implementation follows a template-based approach with domain-specific configurations, allowing for extensibility to new monitoring domains beyond the initial requirements.
