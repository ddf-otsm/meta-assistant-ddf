How can I define a Software Engineering Mindset or Framework where Instead of developing a new event for a user to log on a system, or a new page for a new feature, I create first the software that develops the page, and then ask for the softwar to create the page instance?

This mindset is even more important now that we have agents and AI helping us to programm

Software Engineering Mindset for Automation
Reasoned for 48 seconds
Below is one way to think about and articulate a “meta-software engineering mindset”—a framework or philosophy in which you build software that generates software (rather than manually coding each feature). This approach is especially relevant now that we have AI-driven “developer assistants” and agent-based technologies that can automate large swaths of implementation work.

1. Core Idea: Generate Instead of Code
Traditional Approach
If you need a new “login event” or a new “settings page,” you would typically (a) write models, (b) build routes, (c) craft front-end components, (d) handle validation, (e) test. It’s a lot of boilerplate or repeated patterns.

Meta-Engineering Approach
Instead of directly coding the new feature, you build a generator (or platform, or framework) that automates or semi-automates that set of steps. Your job transforms from coding the final artifact to:

Designing the meta-models (what an “event” or “page” means in your domain),

Coding the generator (the “software that writes the software”),

Invoking the generator with a high-level specification (e.g., “Create a settings page for user roles”).

This is akin to model-driven development, code generation, domain-specific languages, or “Infrastructure as Code,” but now extended to entire features (e.g., user flows, pages, endpoints).

2. Benefits of the Meta-Engineering Mindset
Speed & Consistency
Instead of building repetitive components over and over, you define them once in the generator. You ensure that all generated pages or events follow the same conventions, meet the same security criteria, etc.

Reduced Risk of Bugs
Common mistakes (typos, missed validation checks, missing logging calls) are avoided because the generator handles them uniformly.

Domain-Centric
By modeling your domain at a higher level, you focus on what you want to build (e.g., “a user needs a new setting for notifications”), not how every line of code should look.

Easier Maintenance
If you need to change a standard practice (e.g., a new logging format, a new compliance requirement), you do it once in the generator, and all generated artifacts are automatically updated.

AI/Agent Augmentation
AI can take your meta-model plus your generation logic and further refine or extend the generated artifacts. This synergy reduces the developer’s toil while ensuring high-level oversight.

3. Building the Framework: Practical Steps
Identify the Repetitive Patterns

List all the features that repeatedly appear in your system (e.g., pages, events, forms, CRUD endpoints).

Note what changes from instance to instance (the “variable” parts) and what stays constant (the “template” parts).

Define Your Meta-Models

Conceptual model: For example, a “page” in your system might have a title, route, data bindings, component tree, user permissions, etc.

Events could define an entity, an action name, data payload, triggers, logging formats, etc.

Choose a Format for Specification

Could be a YAML/JSON DSL, a custom DSL, or a combination of config files plus code stubs.

The key is: developers (and possibly AI agents) write a specification that says what they want built, not how.

Implement the Generator

Write the code that takes your specification (YAML, DSL, etc.) and transforms it into actual code artifacts: front-end components, back-end routes, database migrations, etc.

Use templating engines (e.g., Mustache, Handlebars, EJS, etc.) or code transformation libraries, or even standard code-generation frameworks.

Versioning & Iteration

Generators themselves need versioning just like any other piece of software.

Whenever you update the generator logic, you can re-generate artifacts or create migrations if needed.

Integration & Deployment

Decide how the generation fits into your CI/CD pipeline. For example:

Developer or AI assistant updates the specification file.

The generator runs (manually or automatically) to produce the new or updated feature code.

Code gets tested, validated, merged, and deployed.

4. Infusing AI and Agents
a. AI-Assisted Specification
Your developers (or non-technical stakeholders) might describe the desired feature in natural language.

An LLM (like ChatGPT) can parse that description, map it to your meta-model, and produce the appropriate DSL specification automatically.

b. AI-Assisted Generation
The same or a different LLM can handle parts of the code-generation logic that aren’t strictly templated.

For example, if a specialized UI layout is required, the AI can generate a React/Vue component that extends the baseline from the generator.

c. Agents for Continuous Evolution
Agents can observe the system’s usage (analytics, logs) and automatically suggest (or create) new events or page tweaks, then run the generation pipeline to produce them.

This is particularly powerful if you have microservices or plugin-based architectures that can be dynamically extended.

5. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them
Over-Generation

If the generator is too generic, you might end up with hundreds of partially relevant features or config bloat.

Mitigation: Keep your DSL/metadata focused on the truly repetitive patterns.

Code Drift

If developers manually edit generated code, it can “drift” from the generator.

Mitigation: Provide clear extension points, or adopt a “regenerate safely” mechanism (similar to how many frameworks manage partial overrides).

Poor Documentation

Teams need to understand how to write or maintain the specs. If it becomes too opaque, it defeats the benefit.

Mitigation: Document your meta-models and generator usage meticulously. Provide examples and templates.

Complex Debugging

Debugging generated code can be trickier than debugging hand-written code.

Mitigation: Ensure the generator outputs well-structured, readable code and integrates with standard logging/tracing so you can debug easily in the final runtime.

AI Hallucinations or Inaccuracies

Using an LLM to create specs or code can lead to errors or “made-up” references.

Mitigation: Always keep a review process in the loop. Treat AI outputs as drafts to be validated (particularly in critical or production systems).

6. Cultural and Organizational Implications
a. Developer Mindset Shift
Your developers will shift from “I’m coding the feature by hand” to “I’m coding (and maintaining) the generator and writing high-level specs.”

This requires new skills in domain modeling, code generation pipelines, and possibly the creation of DSLs.

b. Collaboration with Non-Engineers
Because your features are now described at a higher level, product managers and business analysts might directly contribute to the specs.

This can foster tighter collaboration but also requires clear guardrails.

c. Governance and Compliance
A generator can bake in compliance rules (e.g., GDPR, security best practices).

That ensures every generated feature is automatically up to your organization’s standards.

7. Example Implementation Scenario
Domain: Internal admin dashboards.

Meta-Model: A “DashboardPage” object has attributes like:

Title

User roles allowed

Data source & query definition

UI components list

Validation rules

Generator:

Reads a YAML file like dashboard-pages.yaml containing multiple definitions:

yaml
Copy
- name: UserRolesSettings
  title: User Roles
  userRolesAllowed: [admin]
  dataSources: 
    - name: rolesApi
      endpoint: /api/roles
  components:
    - type: table
      dataSource: rolesApi
      columns: [name, permissions]
Outputs:

React code for the page (with a table, data bindings, route config).

Express (or similar) backend route stubs if needed.

Tests or snapshots that confirm the table is rendered.

Flow:

Developer or PM updates dashboard-pages.yaml with new pages or modifies existing pages.

The generator is run.

The newly generated artifacts are tested & deployed.

8. Wrapping Up
Shifting from a direct, manual coding mindset to a meta-software engineering mindset means you’re always looking for opportunities to build the tool that builds. It requires up-front investment in designing your generator framework and domain models, but pays off through rapid feature generation, consistency, and the ability to leverage AI-based agents and tools effectively.

In today’s landscape—where large language models can not only generate code but also interpret domain specs—the timing is perfect to adopt this approach. Think of it as building a platform for consistent, scalable, and automatable software creation, so that your team (human or AI) can focus on higher-value tasks rather than writing boilerplate over and over.





You said:
Okay this is very theoretical, what papers and current frameworks or open source projects deploy this on a pragmatic way?


ChatGPT said:
pragmatic software generation tools
Reasoned for 3m 2s
Below is a set of pragmatic, real-world projects and frameworks (both open source and commercial) as well as academic literature that reflect the “meta-software engineering” approach—i.e., building software that generates software. These range from classic Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) tooling, to code generators, to modern scaffolding frameworks, to AI-driven developer assistants.

1. Open Source & Industry Frameworks
a. JHipster
Description: A widely used application generator that combines Spring Boot (Java) on the back end with Angular/React/Vue on the front end. You define your entities (domain model) in a domain language (JDL—JHipster Domain Language), and JHipster generates CRUD modules, tests, CI config, etc.

Relevance: This is a great example of a “meta-framework” that automates much of the boilerplate for a full-stack app. You work mostly in terms of domain definitions, and JHipster handles the scaffolding.

Website: https://www.jhipster.tech/

b. Yeoman
Description: A generic scaffolding tool for front-end and back-end projects. You can write “Yeoman generators” for practically anything—React components, microservices, Express APIs, etc.

Relevance: Often used in large teams to unify project structures. Instead of coding the same directory structure and config files repeatedly, you define a Yeoman generator that produces them automatically.

Website: https://yeoman.io/

c. Rails Scaffolding
Description: Ruby on Rails famously popularized “scaffolding”: with a single command (e.g., rails generate scaffold Post title:string body:text), Rails generates an entire CRUD interface, migrations, controllers, and views.

Relevance: Although it’s not as “meta” as a dedicated DSL-based system, Rails scaffolding remains one of the most approachable code-generation examples that mainstream developers have used for over a decade.

Website: https://rubyonrails.org/

d. Nx & Angular Schematics
Description: Nx (from Nrwl) is a suite of tools for monorepos in JavaScript/TypeScript. It uses “generators” (formerly known as schematics in Angular) to create new modules, libraries, components, etc.

Relevance: In large enterprise monorepos, Nx generators standardize how new features or sub-projects are built, ensuring uniform structure, linting, and configuration.

Website: https://nx.dev/

e. Hygen
Description: A fast, standalone code generator that uses straightforward templates. You can run hygen component new MyComponent and have it produce a React/Vue/Svelte/whatever component with standard boilerplate.

Relevance: Hygen is a simpler alternative to Yeoman that many teams use for smaller, targeted generation tasks.

Website: http://www.hygen.io/

f. OpenAPI Generator / Swagger Codegen
Description: Automatically generates server stubs and client SDKs in multiple languages from an OpenAPI/Swagger spec.

Relevance: This is a prime example of domain-driven meta-coding. You define your API at a high level (the OpenAPI specification), and the generator produces the actual code in Node, Java, Python, etc.

Website: https://openapi-generator.tech/

g. Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)
Description: A mature framework from the Eclipse world for defining models (via Ecore) and generating Java code, model editors, etc. from those models.

Relevance: Heavily used in model-driven engineering (MDE) scenarios. Once your meta-model is set, EMF can produce the data structures and even partial UI editors.

Website: https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/

h. JetBrains MPS (Meta Programming System)
Description: A language workbench that lets you define domain-specific languages (DSLs) and then generate code or other artifacts from those DSLs.

Relevance: MPS is arguably one of the most advanced “language-oriented” platforms, letting you design structured DSLs and create specialized editors and generators.

Website: https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/

2. Academic & Theoretical Foundations
a. Software Factories
Reference: Software Factories: Assembling Applications with Patterns, Models, Frameworks, and Tools by Jack Greenfield, Keith Short, Steve Cook, Stuart Kent (2004, Addison-Wesley).

Core Idea: Proposes an approach to software development that uses domain-specific models, frameworks, and generators to rapidly build entire applications. This was a pioneer text in the .NET world and remains conceptually relevant.

b. Model-Driven Engineering / Model-Driven Architecture
Reference: OMG’s Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) initiative, which started around 2001 (https://www.omg.org/mda/).

Core Idea: You define platform-independent models (PIM), then transform them into platform-specific models (PSM) and final code. Tools like EMF, Papyrus UML, and Rational Software Architect grew out of this.

Book: Model-Driven Software Engineering in Practice by Marco Brambilla, Jordi Cabot, and Manuel Wimmer is a good modern overview.

c. Domain-Specific Modeling (DSM)
Reference: Domain-Specific Modeling by Steven Kelly and Juha-Pekka Tolvanen (Wiley, 2008).

Core Idea: Argues that the highest productivity gains come from creating domain-specific languages (DSLs) and generators that directly map to your problem space, rather than using generic UML.

d. Language Workbenches
Reference: Martin Fowler’s article “Language Workbenches: The Killer-App for Domain Specific Languages?” (martinfowler.com/articles/languageWorkbench.html).

Core Idea: Explores the concept of “language workbenches” (like JetBrains MPS), which let teams define custom DSLs and tooling to generate large portions of code with domain-specific notations.

3. Recent/AI-Enabled Approaches
a. GitHub Copilot / ChatGPT Code Generation
Description: These tools don’t just produce code from text prompts; they can also help generate boilerplate or transform higher-level instructions into working stubs.

Relevance: While not strictly a “meta-framework,” the emergent pattern is to maintain a formal or semi-formal specification (in your doc/comments/DSL), then let AI fill in the details.

b. LangChain / LLM Agents
Description: LangChain (Python/JS) helps structure “agentic” LLMs that can read & write files, run code, etc. You can integrate it into a pipeline where the agent processes a DSL or specification and auto-generates entire modules.

Relevance: A step toward runtime meta-programming with AI, as an LLM can interpret a high-level spec, call generation scripts, then refine the output in a loop.

4. Putting It All Together
Start with a Known Generator

If you want a quick entry point, try JHipster (for Java/TypeScript) or Rails scaffolding. These will illustrate how domain-driven scaffolding and meta-programming can rapidly spin up features.

Explore DSL-Driven Tools

If your domain is very specific, consider Eclipse EMF or JetBrains MPS to define a formal meta-model and generate code from it.

Incorporate AI

Tools like GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT can help you create or refine DSLs, generate specs, or produce custom templates for frameworks like Yeoman, Nx, or Hygen.

Check the Academic Backbone

If you want a deeper theoretical underpinning, look at Software Factories and the MDE/MDA literature. They address methodical ways to create “platforms that build applications.”

5. Conclusion
While the idea of “writing software that writes software” might sound lofty or purely academic, many mainstream frameworks and projects already practice it in some form—particularly scaffolding (Rails, Nx, JHipster) and DSL-based (EMF, MPS) approaches. For a practical starting point, experiment with these open source projects to see how your team can capture domain models in a single source of truth, then autogenerate consistent, boilerplate-free features. Over time, you can layer in advanced language workbenches or LLM-based generation to fully embrace a meta-software engineering workflow.

Reasoned for 1m 17s
Below is a deeper look at how “meta” each framework or tool is, plus a side-by-side comparison of their focus areas, adoption, and approach to code generation. We’ll also clarify why some tools (like Rails scaffolding) are not as meta as a dedicated DSL-based system, and why OpenAPI Generator stands out for modern, widespread adoption in web API development.

1. What Does “Not as Meta” Mean?
When we say a tool is “not as meta,” we generally mean:

It doesn’t fully separate the domain model from the implementation. A “fully meta” approach gives you a domain-specific language (DSL) or a model that describes your system independently of the target tech stack. Then you generate multiple artifacts (code, configs, docs) from that abstract model.

It often generates code directly from partial or implementation-driven specs, rather than a purely abstract domain model. For instance, Rails scaffolding uses field types on the command line or the database schema to quickly generate CRUD. That’s code generation—but it’s somewhat “closer to the metal” than a high-level DSL that describes “business objects” or “conceptual events.”

There’s less focus on multi-platform or wide-scope generation. Tools that offer a “full meta” approach (like EMF or MPS) aim to let you define your system’s domain once, then generate multiple outputs (e.g., Java code, XML, forms, diagrams) from it. More traditional scaffolding (like Rails) might only target a single stack in a single programming language.

In short: “Not as meta” = The generator is helpful but more tied to a specific tech or language, with less emphasis on an abstract domain model or DSL that you can reuse or transform across different platforms.

2. Frameworks & Tools: High-Level Comparison
Below is a table summarizing each tool/framework along a few key dimensions:

Tool/Framework	Primary Domain	Approach to Generation	DSL or Spec?	Meta-Level	Adoption & Ecosystem
Rails Scaffolding	Ruby on Rails (web apps)	Generates CRUD code (models, controllers, views) from simple field specs	Minimal spec via CLI args or DB schema	Low-to-Medium	Very popular in Rails community
Yeoman	Front-end/back-end scaffolding	Generic templating engine; “generators” for any tech stack	Optional config or prompts	Low-to-Medium	Moderately adopted, especially in JS/TS
Nx / Angular Schematics	JavaScript/TypeScript monorepos	CLI-based scaffolding (libraries, components); focuses on consistent structure	Configuration-based “schematics” DSL	Low-to-Medium	Growing in enterprise JS/TS monorepos
Hygen	Generic code scaffolding	Lightweight templates for any language or framework	Templates with minimal config	Low	Simple, fast, widely used in small teams
JHipster	Full-stack (Java + JS) apps	Domain-based (JDL) => generates front-end, back-end, tests, CI configs	JHipster Domain Language (JDL)	Medium	Well-known in enterprise; strong community
OpenAPI Generator / Swagger Codegen	REST APIs (server & client)	Generates server stubs & client SDKs from OpenAPI specs (JSON/YAML)	OpenAPI Spec (DSL for APIs)	Medium-to-High	Extremely popular across many languages
Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)	Model-Driven Engineering (Java)	Model definitions in Ecore => generates Java code, editors, plus transformations	Ecore (meta-model)	High	Mature, used in enterprise & academia
JetBrains MPS	Language workbench (DSL design)	Define custom DSLs & structure; generates multiple artifacts from that DSL	Custom DSL (structured editor)	High	Niche but powerful; used for advanced DSLs
Key Observations
Rails Scaffolding

Strength: Quick and easy for CRUD generation in a single (Rails) environment.

Weakness: Doesn’t abstract your domain in a separate meta-model or DSL.

Conclusion: It’s scaffolding that saves time, but not a “write once, generate many ways” approach.

Yeoman / Nx / Hygen

Strength: Flexible code scaffolding with templates; can be used across multiple frameworks.

Weakness: Tends to revolve around project structure or “best-practice” boilerplate, not domain-level modeling.

Conclusion: Great for repetitive tasks and enforcing structure, but not truly domain- or DSL-centric.

JHipster

Strength: Incorporates a domain language (JDL) that represents entities and relationships, then generates a full-stack solution (Java + Angular/React/Vue).

Weakness: Primarily targets the Java ecosystem and has a narrower “golden path.”

Conclusion: This is more “meta” than simple scaffolding because you define your business entities in JDL, from which multiple layers (DB, back end, front end) are generated.

OpenAPI Generator / Swagger Codegen

Strength: Very widely adopted; the OpenAPI spec is effectively a DSL for REST APIs. You can generate server stubs (Spring, Node, Python, etc.) and client SDKs in 50+ languages.

Weakness: Focused only on describing APIs, not entire application domains (like UI layouts, business processes, etc.).

Conclusion: It’s quite “meta” for APIs specifically—once you define your REST endpoints and schemas in OpenAPI, you can output consistent code across many different platforms. This is one of the most modern and heavily adopted code generation approaches in real-world dev teams.

Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)

Strength: A truly model-driven approach. You define an Ecore meta-model (your domain), and EMF can generate Java classes, model editors, etc.

Weakness: It can be heavyweight; mostly used in the Eclipse ecosystem.

Conclusion: High “meta” factor—classic MDE tooling. Great if you need a robust, thoroughly typed domain model that transforms into various artifacts.

JetBrains MPS

Strength: Allows you to create custom DSLs and “projectional editors”—it’s extremely powerful for building your own language(s).

Weakness: Learning curve is high, and adoption is niche compared to mainstream frameworks.

Conclusion: Arguably the most “meta” approach if you want to build domain-specific languages from scratch and generate multiple forms of output.

3. Why OpenAPI Generator Is So Widely Adopted
Widespread Need for API Consistency: Modern microservices and front-end/back-end separation rely heavily on clearly defined HTTP APIs.

Standardized Specification (OpenAPI): Teams can agree on a single YAML/JSON file describing endpoints, request/response schemas, auth, etc.

Multi-Language Support: The same spec can generate:

Java server stubs (Spring Boot)

Node.js Express stubs

Python Flask stubs

Golang servers

TypeScript/JavaScript/Python/Swift client SDKs

…and more

Mature Ecosystem: Built-in templates, active community, ongoing development by the OpenAPI Initiative and contributors.

Focus on Interoperability: Because it’s about standard HTTP/REST endpoints, it’s relevant for any service that needs an API boundary.

In other words, OpenAPI Generator hits the sweet spot: it’s domain-specific enough (focused on REST APIs) to automate all the tedious parts of writing boilerplate code, but flexible enough (multiple languages, frameworks, clients) to be useful across many stacks.

4. Why Some Tools Are Considered “Less Meta”
To expand on the earlier statement: Rails scaffolding or Angular schematics typically look at local parameters (like a DB table or a command-line argument for model fields) and generate only in the context of a single tech stack. They’re extremely convenient, but:

They don’t define a high-level domain model or language that you can transform for other frameworks or platforms.

They usually produce code that remains tied to the app’s existing architecture, rather than offering an abstract representation (like an Ecore model, a JHipster Domain Language, or an OpenAPI spec) that’s truly decoupled from the final code.

Hence, they’re not operating at the same “meta” level as, say, OpenAPI (where you can choose different languages to generate) or EMF (which can produce multiple representations from one abstract model).

5. Choosing the Right Level of “Meta”
Low-to-Medium Meta (Rails, Yeoman, Nx, Hygen)

Great for quick starts, consistent file structures, and simple CRUD generation.

Ideal for teams who want just enough code generation without adopting a complex DSL or modeling framework.

Medium Meta (JHipster, OpenAPI Generator)

If you’re building a standard full-stack Java/TypeScript app (JHipster) or strongly need to define your REST APIs in a reusable spec (OpenAPI), these give you robust generation with a moderate learning curve.

High Meta (EMF, JetBrains MPS)

If you want true model-driven engineering or domain-specific languages with potential for multi-artifact generation, these are powerful.

Expect a higher initial investment to define meta-models/DSLs and set up generation pipelines.

6. Final Thoughts
OpenAPI Generator is indeed modern and extremely widely adopted for web API development; it’s a strong example of a domain-specific DSL (the OpenAPI spec) that yields broad benefits (server + client code, docs, and more).

Tools like Rails scaffolding or Yeoman are simpler and more “immediate” but less abstract. They’re not bad—they’re just aimed at fast bootstrapping within a single tech.

JHipster offers a good middle ground if you need a “big-bang” generator for a standard full-stack Java+JavaScript architecture.

EMF and MPS are for teams who are comfortable investing heavily in a modeling/DSL approach that can pay off in complex, large-scale projects (often in enterprise or specialized domains).

In summary, any code generation approach sits on a spectrum: from quick scaffolding (less meta, narrower focus) to formal DSL-based model-driven engineering (more meta, broader transform possibilities). OpenAPI Generator succeeds in real-world adoption because it strikes a balance: it standardizes how you describe REST APIs (the DSL) without demanding you move to an entirely different modeling universe, and it outputs code for many languages—making it highly practical for modern microservice ecosystems.

Request for o1 pro mode
Reasoned for 54 seconds
Below is a filtered list of the more “high-level DSL” (Domain-Specific Language) or model-driven frameworks—i.e., tools that let you define an abstract domain model or DSL and then generate multiple artifacts (code, editors, config, etc.) from that model. I’ve excluded simpler scaffolding tools (Rails, Yeoman, Nx, Hygen, etc.) that are more tied to a single stack or lack a true DSL/metamodel layer.

1. JetBrains MPS
What It Is

A language workbench that lets you define custom DSLs with a “projectional” editor (no raw text editing, but a structured approach).

You build languages and generators that can output Java, XML, or other formats.

Why It’s High-Level

You are designing your own DSL from scratch, defining syntax, semantics, and generation rules.

You can produce multiple artifacts from the same DSL (e.g., code, documentation, config).

Use Cases: Complex domains where standard languages are insufficient, advanced model-driven projects in enterprise or specialized industries.

Website: https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/

2. Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)
What It Is

A mature Model-Driven Engineering framework in the Eclipse ecosystem.

You define Ecore meta-models (i.e., the DSL that describes your domain concepts), and EMF generates Java classes, model editors, and more.

Why It’s High-Level

Ecore is an abstract modeling language; once you define your domain, you can generate multiple forms of output.

Strong integration with other Eclipse-based modeling tools (Sirius for custom diagrams, Xtext for textual DSLs, etc.).

Use Cases: Enterprise modeling, tool-building, or any scenario where you want robust typed models and auto-generated code/editors.

Website: https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/

3. Xtext (Eclipse Project)
What It Is

A framework for building textual DSLs on top of the Eclipse platform.

You define your grammar, and Xtext generates a parser, an Eclipse-based editor (with syntax highlighting, code completion), and optionally code generation.

Why It’s High-Level

Like MPS, but for textual DSLs rather than projectional editors.

Facilitates the entire toolchain: from grammar definition to code generation and IDE integration.

Use Cases: Whenever you want a custom textual DSL (rather than modeling in UML or Ecore), plus an advanced IDE experience “for free.”

Website: https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/

4. Sirius (Eclipse Project)
What It Is

Lets you create custom graphical modeling workbenches (diagrams, tables, trees) based on an EMF meta-model.

Focused on visual DSLs: you define a viewpoint specification, and it generates a custom modeling environment.

Why It’s High-Level

You define your domain with EMF/Ecore; Sirius then builds a domain-specific modeling tool with diagrams that correspond to your concepts.

Completely separate from low-level code details; you work at the meta-model layer.

Use Cases: Graphical editors for domain experts (e.g., workflows, state machines, circuit diagrams) that tie back to a formal domain model.

Website: https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/

5. MetaEdit+
What It Is

A commercial (but academically well-known) DSM tool by MetaCase, focusing on high-level domain-specific modeling and generation.

You define your domain concepts, notations (graphical or textual), and generation rules.

Why It’s High-Level

Entirely built around domain-specific modeling (DSM). It’s arguably one of the earliest tools that fully embraced the “DSL for everything” philosophy.

Use Cases: Large-scale industrial DSLs, often in embedded systems or product-line engineering.

Website: https://www.metacase.com/

6. OpenAPI Generator (Honorable Mention)
Why a Mention Here?

Technically an API-oriented DSL (the OpenAPI specification).

If your domain is specifically “web APIs,” then it is a high-level DSL describing endpoints, schemas, authentication, etc.

Generates server stubs and client SDKs in many languages.

Caveat

It’s still more narrow than something like EMF or MPS, which allow you to model any domain concept.

But within the REST API domain, it’s an extremely popular, modern DSL-based approach.

7. JHipster (Contextual Mention)
Why a Mention Here?

JHipster uses the “JHipster Domain Language” (JDL) to define your entities, relationships, etc.

It’s “meta” in the sense that you specify domain objects in JDL, and JHipster then generates your Spring Boot back end, front end, tests, etc.

Caveat

It’s more specialized (Java + Angular/React/Vue) and not a generic DSL solution like EMF or MPS.

It sits somewhere between scaffolding and a full-blown DSL platform.

8. Academic/Conceptual Foundations
If you want to go deeper into the why and how of high-level DSLs:

Domain-Specific Modeling by Steven Kelly and Juha-Pekka Tolvanen (Wiley, 2008).

Model-Driven Software Engineering in Practice by Brambilla, Cabot, Wimmer.

Language Workbenches (Martin Fowler’s article “Language Workbenches: The Killer-App for Domain Specific Languages?”).

These detail the philosophy behind building domain-specific models and generating code or other artifacts from them.

9. Conclusion
When it comes to true high-level DSL or model-driven approaches, focus on:

JetBrains MPS for projectional editor-based DSLs.

EMF (plus Xtext/Sirius) for a robust Eclipse-based modeling stack, covering textual and graphical DSLs.

MetaEdit+ for a commercial, dedicated DSM environment.

If you only need a domain-specific approach for REST APIs, OpenAPI is a pragmatic DSL that’s extremely popular and well-supported.

Each of these tools/frameworks allows you to work above the implementation details—describing your system or domain in an abstract DSL/metamodel—then generate the relevant code, configuration, or other artifacts, giving you a truly “meta” or model-driven experience.

OpenAPI Generator and EMF Integration
Reasoned for 1m 10s
Short Answer: There’s no official, widely adopted “push-button” integration that takes an EMF/Ecore model and directly invokes OpenAPI Generator out of the box. However, it’s absolutely possible to combine them in a model-driven toolchain by:

Defining a transformation from your EMF/Ecore model into an OpenAPI specification (YAML/JSON), and

Feeding that generated OpenAPI spec into OpenAPI Generator to produce server/client code.

You’d likely have to implement or customize such a transformation yourself (or use a specialized Eclipse-based tool if available), but it’s a well-trodden path in Model-Driven Engineering (MDE).

1. Why They’re Separate Tools
EMF (Eclipse Modeling Framework) focuses on creating and manipulating domain models in Ecore. You describe the structure, relationships, and constraints of your domain—completely agnostic of how (or even if) it’s exposed over a REST API.

OpenAPI Generator transforms a REST API description (HTTP endpoints, request/response schemas, authentication, etc.) into actual code (server stubs and/or client SDKs). It expects input in the form of an OpenAPI/Swagger spec.

They target different layers of abstraction:

EMF’s Ecore model is about domain concepts (e.g., Person, Order, Invoice) and their relationships.

OpenAPI is about endpoints and JSON schemas (e.g., GET /api/persons/{id}, with a Person object in the response).

Hence, they don’t automatically “know about” each other, but you can bridge the gap.

2. Possible Integration Workflow
A typical EMF + OpenAPI workflow might look like:

Model the Domain with EMF

You define Ecore classes (e.g., Person, Address, Order) and their relationships, data types, constraints, etc.

Generate or Transform to OpenAPI Schemas

Write (or use) a model-to-text transformation (e.g., using Eclipse ATL, Acceleo, Xpand, or a custom Java-based transformation) that converts each Ecore class into an OpenAPI “schema” definition.

You also define how Ecore references and operations map to OpenAPI endpoints (if you want a RESTful interface).

Produce the OpenAPI Specification

The transformation yields an openapi.yaml or swagger.yaml file describing your endpoints, parameters, request/response objects, etc., all rooted in your Ecore domain model.

Run OpenAPI Generator

Feed openapi.yaml into the OpenAPI Generator CLI or Gradle/Maven plugin to generate server stubs (Java, Python, Node, etc.) or client SDKs.

Refine & Iterate

If you adjust the Ecore model (add a new entity, change a field), you regenerate the OpenAPI spec and re-run OpenAPI Generator.

This setup ensures your domain model in EMF is the single source of truth. The OpenAPI spec is derived from that model, which means your REST API stays in sync with the evolving domain.

3. Are There Ready-to-Use Integrations?
No Official Plugin: There isn’t a standard Eclipse plugin included with EMF that exports directly to OpenAPI.

Community / Custom Solutions: You can find some community attempts on GitHub or in academic projects that link UML/Ecore to Swagger/OpenAPI. For example, some might do UML-to-OpenAPI transformations with Papyrus (UML) + ATL. Others might generate partial specs that you can merge manually.

If you don’t find an exact match, it’s still very feasible to build your own generator or transformations, since:

EMF’s model can be programmatically accessed with Java or Xtend.

OpenAPI YAML is just text; you can use templating libraries (like Acceleo, Xpand, Velocity, or Mustache) or a model-to-model transformation language (ATL, QVT) to produce the OpenAPI structures.

4. Design Considerations & Tips
Scope of Generation

Decide whether you want to generate only data schemas (e.g., mapping Ecore Person → OpenAPI schema “Person”) or also generate endpoints (e.g., CRUD, search). If you need dynamic queries or complex operations, you’ll have to define how those map from your domain into REST operations.

Naming & Conventions

Ecore might have naming that doesn’t align 1:1 with REST conventions. You might need a naming layer or “pluralization” logic (e.g., Person → /persons or /people).

Versioning / Round-Trip

Keep in mind that once you generate your OpenAPI spec, you might manually tweak it. If you want to preserve changes, consider a “round-trip” approach or a partial override mechanism so you don’t lose manual edits on regeneration.

Complex Relationships

Some domain models are more object-oriented than typical REST resources. You might need to flatten or rewrite certain references for a purely RESTful approach, or choose a hypermedia style.

Validation

If you have constraints in Ecore (e.g., min/max cardinalities, data types), ensure they get translated into JSON Schema constraints in the OpenAPI spec (e.g., minimum, maximum, pattern).

5. Example Scenario
You have an Ecore meta-model with classes: Customer, Order, and LineItem.

You want a REST API with:

GET /customers/{id}, POST /customers, etc.

GET /customers/{id}/orders, etc.

You build a small transformation in Acceleo that:

Iterates over each Ecore EClass.

Maps attributes to OpenAPI’s properties with matching type, format, etc.

Creates endpoints (optional) for basic CRUD using a naming convention (e.g., EClass.name → /{className.toLowerCase()}s).

You run that transformation to produce openapi.yaml.

You run openapi-generator-cli generate -i openapi.yaml -g spring to get a Spring Boot server stub.

You fill in the business logic, possibly referencing the original Ecore-based data classes for persistence.

6. Final Verdict
Yes, OpenAPI Generator can be used in tandem with EMF—there’s no built-in “EMF → OpenAPI” plugin that ships out of the box, but it’s straightforward to create or adapt a model-to-text transformation that exports an OpenAPI spec from your Ecore model.

This approach is quite common in Model-Driven Engineering scenarios where an abstract domain model is the single source of truth, and different “viewpoints” (in this case, a REST API) are generated automatically.

Be prepared to either code your own transformations or look for community solutions that do the mapping. Once that’s in place, your pipeline can auto-generate robust, up-to-date REST stubs/clients from a high-level EMF domain definition.
