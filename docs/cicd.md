# CI/CD Documentation

## Overview
This document describes the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) setup for the project.

## Workflows

### CI Workflow (`ci.yml`)
Triggered on:
- Push to `dev` and `main` branches
- Pull requests to `dev` and `main` branches

Steps:
1. Run tests
2. Code quality checks (ESLint, Prettier)
3. Build verification
4. Security scanning
5. Coverage reports

### CD Workflow (`cd.yml`)
Triggered on:
- Push to `dev` branch (automatic deployment to development)
- Push to `main` branch (manual approval required for production)

Steps:
1. Build application
2. Run smoke tests
3. Deploy to environment
4. Health checks
5. Slack notifications

### Release Workflow (`release.yml`)
Triggered on:
- Push of version tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`)

Steps:
1. Build production assets
2. Generate changelog
3. Create GitHub release
4. Upload artifacts

## Branch Protection Rules

### Main Branch
- Requires pull request approvals
- Must pass CI checks
- No force pushes allowed
- Linear history required

### Dev Branch
- Must pass CI checks
- No force pushes allowed

## Creating Releases

To create a new release:

1. Ensure all changes are committed
2. Run the release script:
   ```bash
   npm run release <version>
   ```
   Example: `npm run release 1.0.0`

3. The script will:
   - Update version in package.json
   - Create a commit
   - Create and push a tag
   - Trigger the release workflow

## Environment Setup

### Development
- Automatic deployments from dev branch
- Feature flags enabled
- Debug logging enabled

### Production
- Manual approval required
- Feature flags controlled
- Production logging level

## Monitoring

### Metrics Tracked
- Build time
- Test coverage
- Deployment frequency
- Error rates

### Alerts
- Build failures
- Test failures
- Deployment failures
- Error rate spikes

## Security

### Secret Management
- All secrets stored in GitHub Secrets
- Environment-specific secrets
- Regular rotation schedule

### Access Control
- Branch protection rules
- Environment access restrictions
- Deployment approvals

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. Failed builds
   - Check test logs
   - Verify dependencies
   - Check build scripts

2. Failed deployments
   - Check environment health
   - Verify credentials
   - Check deployment logs

### Support
For issues with the CI/CD pipeline, contact:
- GitHub Actions: Create an issue with label `ci-cd`
- Deployment issues: Contact DevOps team

## Best Practices

1. Commit Messages
   - Use conventional commits
   - Include ticket numbers
   - Keep messages clear and concise

2. Pull Requests
   - Use PR template
   - Include tests
   - Update documentation

3. Deployments
   - Monitor deployments
   - Verify health checks
   - Be ready to rollback

## Future Improvements

1. Short-term
   - Add more automated tests
   - Improve deployment speed
   - Enhanced monitoring

2. Long-term
   - Blue-green deployments
   - Canary releases
   - Automated rollbacks
