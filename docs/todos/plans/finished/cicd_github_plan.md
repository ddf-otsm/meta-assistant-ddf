# CI/CD GitHub Integration Plan - 100% Complete

## 1. High-Level Context and Strategy

### 1.1 Mission, Aspiration, Purpose, Objectives, and Goals (MAPOG)
- **Mission**: Establish a robust CI/CD pipeline for automated testing, building, and deployment
- **Aspiration**: Create a seamless development workflow that ensures code quality and reliability
- **Purpose**: Automate testing and deployment processes to reduce manual errors and improve productivity
- **Objectives**:
  1. Set up GitHub Actions workflows for dev and main branches
  2. Configure branch protection rules
  3. Implement automated testing and code quality checks
  4. Set up automated deployment pipelines
- **Goals**:
  - **Short-term** (1-2 weeks): Configure basic CI pipeline with testing
  - **Mid-term** (2-4 weeks): Implement CD pipeline for dev environment
  - **Long-term** (4-8 weeks): Full production deployment automation

### 1.2 Branch Strategy
- **Main Branch**: Production-ready code
  - Requires PR approvals
  - Must pass all tests
  - Auto-deploys to production
- **Dev Branch**: Integration branch
  - Regular integration of feature branches
  - Auto-deploys to staging
  - Less strict PR requirements

## 2. Implementation Plan

### 2.1 GitHub Configuration
1. **Branch Protection Rules**
   - Configure using GitHub CLI
   - Set up required reviews
   - Enforce status checks
   - Prevent force pushes

2. **Environment Setup**
   - Development environment
   - Staging environment
   - Production environment
   - Environment secrets management

### 2.2 CI Pipeline Components
1. **Code Quality**
   - ESLint for TypeScript/JavaScript
   - Prettier for code formatting
   - SonarQube for code analysis

2. **Testing**
   - Unit tests with Vitest
   - Integration tests
   - End-to-end tests
   - Test coverage reports

3. **Security**
   - Dependency scanning
   - SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
   - Secret scanning
   - License compliance

### 2.3 CD Pipeline Components
1. **Build Process**
   - TypeScript compilation
   - Asset optimization
   - Docker image creation
   - Version tagging

2. **Deployment Stages**
   - Development (automatic)
   - Staging (automatic with approval)
   - Production (manual approval required)

3. **Monitoring**
   - Deployment health checks
   - Rollback procedures
   - Performance monitoring
   - Error tracking

## 3. GitHub Actions Workflow Files

### 3.1 CI Workflow (`ci.yml`)
- Trigger on PR to dev/main
- Run tests
- Code quality checks
- Build verification
- Coverage reports

### 3.2 CD Workflow (`cd.yml`)
- Separate workflows for dev and main
- Environment-specific configurations
- Deployment procedures
- Post-deployment checks

### 3.3 Utility Workflows
- Dependency updates
- Security scans
- Documentation generation
- Release management
