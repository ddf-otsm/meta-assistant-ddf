# Test Coverage Improvement Plan

## Current Status
- Overall coverage: 0.6%
- Key areas lacking coverage:
  - Client components
  - Server code
  - Shared code

## Priority Areas
1. Server Components
   - Middleware
   - Routes
   - Error handling
   - Logging

2. Client Components
   - UI components
   - State management
   - API integration

3. Shared Code
   - Utilities
   - Types
   - Constants

## Implementation Plan
1. Server Tests
   - [x] Error handler middleware
   - [x] Routes
   - [ ] Authentication
   - [ ] Database operations

2. Client Tests
   - [ ] Component rendering
   - [ ] User interactions
   - [ ] State updates
   - [ ] API calls

3. Shared Tests
   - [ ] Utility functions
   - [ ] Type validation
   - [ ] Constants usage

## Next Steps
1. Create test files for each component
2. Implement test cases for core functionality
3. Add coverage thresholds to CI/CD pipeline
4. Monitor and improve coverage over time
