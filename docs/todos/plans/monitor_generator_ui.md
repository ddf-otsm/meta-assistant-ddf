# Monitor Generator UI and Repository Agnostic System - 30% Complete

## Overview

This plan builds upon the completed Baby Monitor Transformation system to add:

1. A user-friendly UI that integrates with the backend generator system
2. Repository-agnostic functionality to analyze and transform any git repository
3. Intelligent suggestion system for determining appropriate generator types

The goal is to create a complete system where users can:
- Select any git repository (local or remote)
- Have the system analyze the repository structure
- Receive suggested generators that match the repository's domain and architecture
- Configure and execute transformations through an intuitive UI
- Monitor transformation progress and validate results

## Current Status

- Created directory structure for generator scripts
- Implemented repository analyzer with domain detection
- Implemented repository transformer with template-based approach
- Added CLI interface for user interaction
- Created sample domain configuration for kettle transformation
- Added template support for generated files
- Created shell script to easily run the generator CLI
- Added comprehensive documentation

## Requirements

### Repository Analysis System
- Add capability to clone and analyze any git repository ✅
- Create repository structure analyzer to identify app type, patterns, and domain ✅
- Implement domain detection algorithms to suggest appropriate transformations ✅
- Support various project types (web apps, mobile apps, backends, full-stack, etc.) ✅

### Generator Extension Framework
- Extend the current generator system to be truly repository-agnostic ✅
- Create a plugin system for domain-specific generators ⏳
- Implement generator suggestion algorithm based on repository analysis ✅
- Provide extensibility for community-contributed generators ⏳

### User Interface
- Create a responsive web UI for the generator system ⏳
- Implement repository selection (URL input, repository browser) ✅ (CLI version)
- Build repository analysis visualization ⏳
- Add generator configuration interface ✅ (CLI version)
- Provide real-time transformation progress monitoring ✅ (CLI version)
- Include transformed code preview and diff visualization ⏳
- Implement validation tools for testing generated code ⏳

### Integration Layer
- Create API endpoints for UI-backend communication ⏳
- Implement WebSocket for real-time status updates ⏳
- Add authentication and project management ⏳
- Provide history of transformations with ability to revert or modify ⏳

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Repository Analysis System (30%) - Completed ✅
1. Create repository cloning service ✅
   - Support for GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
   - Local repository import
   - Branch selection

2. Implement repository analyzer ✅
   - File structure analysis
   - Technology stack detection (frameworks, languages)
   - Architecture pattern recognition
   - Domain concept extraction

3. Build domain mapping system ✅
   - Create domain ontology
   - Implement concept mapping between domains
   - Build suggestion engine for target domains

### Phase 2: Generator Extension Framework (25%) - In Progress
1. Refactor existing generator to be repository-agnostic ✅
   - Remove baby-monitor specific code
   - Create abstraction layer for repository structure

2. Implement plugin system for generators ⏳
   - Define generator plugin interface
   - Create plugin discovery and registration system
   - Add configuration schema for plugins

3. Extend template system ✅
   - Create template discovery mechanism
   - Add support for multiple template languages
   - Implement template validation

### Phase 3: User Interface Development (30%) - In Progress
1. Create web application foundation ⏳
   - Set up React application with TypeScript
   - Implement component library and styling
   - Add routing and state management

2. Build repository management interface ✅ (CLI version)
   - Repository URL input
   - Repository browser
   - Repository analysis visualization
   - History of analyzed repositories

3. Implement generator configuration UI ✅ (CLI version)
   - Generator selection based on suggestions
   - Configuration form for generator options
   - Transformation preview
   - Validation settings

4. Create transformation monitoring interface ✅ (CLI version)
   - Progress visualization
   - Log viewer
   - Error reporting
   - Output directory browser

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing (15%) - Not Started
1. Develop API layer ⏳
   - RESTful endpoints for repository and generator management
   - WebSocket for real-time updates
   - Authentication and authorization

2. Implement end-to-end tests ⏳
   - Test various repository types
   - Validate transformation correctness
   - Performance testing

3. Create documentation ✅
   - User guide
   - API documentation
   - Plugin development guide
   - Contribution guidelines

## Next Steps
1. Implement the plugin system for generators
2. Start developing the web UI
3. Create API endpoints for the UI to communicate with the backend
4. Implement end-to-end tests for the system

## Success Criteria
- System can analyze any git repository and suggest appropriate transformations
- UI provides intuitive interface for the entire workflow
- Transformations correctly generate code for new domains
- Plugin system allows easy extension with new generators
- End-to-end tests validate the system works with diverse repository types

## Technical Considerations
- Use a modern tech stack (Node.js, React, TypeScript)
- Implement clean architecture with separation of concerns
- Ensure good error handling and user feedback
- Focus on extensibility for future improvements
- Provide comprehensive logging for debugging
