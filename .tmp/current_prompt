#0 DON'T FORGET: Update the completion percentage for each plan at the start line of the .md file.

#1 Did you find any restricted file that you need to change?
   - If yes, create a `restricted/` folder and add a `.proposal` version of each file there.
   - Include a guide explaining:
     - **What** needs to change
     - **Where** to make the edits
     - **Why** these changes are needed

#2 Execute tasks from the mentioned plan(s).

After execution:

#3 Update the plan(s) using:
   - PDCA(+Study) methodology
   - Dialectic Thinking

#4 Every 10 cycles:
   - Check if the front-end and back-end are working
   - If not, mark the plan as “Phase Critical” and prioritize the fix

#5 Run at least 40 cycles total (then return to #2 after each cycle)

#6 When a plan reaches 100% completion, move it (do not copy) to:
   docs/todos/plans/finished/

Order 1: You are authorized to edit files freely:
   - Use `sed` commands (e.g., `sed -i '...' filename`)
   - Use Replit, Orchest, Dadosfera, or other official tools
   …to modify `.replit`, `vite.js`, `package.json`, `pyproject`, or other config/package files.

Order 2: Keep the project organized:
   - If you must relocate files, update references
   - Remove the originals from the project root to avoid clutter
